  caveats <<~EOS
    Jiva is self-signed and not yet notarized by Apple, so macOS may block the
    first launch ("unidentified developer" / "cannot be opened"). To open it
    the first time (only needed once):

      1. In Finder, open ~/Applications and Control-click (right-click) Jiva.
      2. Choose Open, then Open again in the dialog.

    If macOS still blocks it, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and
    click "Open Anyway", then launch Jiva again.

    On first open, the Welcome window grants permissions and downloads the
    on-device models (Parakeet for dictation and live transcription first).
